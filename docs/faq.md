# FAQ

## What is incus-apply for?

`incus-apply` lets you declare Incus resources in files and apply them repeatedly. It is useful when you want repeatable infrastructure, reviewable config files, and a safer apply flow than typing `incus` commands manually.

## What resources can it manage?

It supports instances, profiles, networks, network ACLs, network zones, storage pools, storage volumes, storage buckets, projects, and cluster groups.

## Why use incus-apply instead of plain incus commands?

Use `incus-apply` when you want your Incus setup to be described in files instead of being driven entirely by manual CLI commands.

That is especially useful when you want to:

- keep resource definitions in version control
- review changes before they are applied
- rerun the same configuration reliably
- share a reproducible setup with other people or environments

Plain `incus` commands are still useful for ad hoc work. `incus-apply` is better when you want repeatability, review, and a file-based workflow.

## What happens when I run it?

It loads your config files, computes what would change, shows a preview, and asks for confirmation before applying unless you use `--yes`.

## Can I preview without changing anything?

Yes. Use `--diff` for text output or `--diff=json` for machine-readable output.

For instances, `config.environment.*` values are redacted in preview output by default. Use `--show-env` if you need the preview to show the actual values.

## Can I use it in CI or scripts?

Yes. Use `--yes` to skip confirmation, and combine it with `--quiet` or `--diff=json` depending on how much output you want.

## What if a resource already exists?

If the resource already exists, `incus-apply` compares the current state with your config and updates it when needed.

## What does unmanaged mean?

It means the resource exists in Incus but does not have valid `incus-apply` tracking state yet. In that case, `incus-apply` warns and falls back to live-state diff/update behavior.

## What if a change requires recreating the resource?

Some fields are create-only. In those cases the preview is marked `recreate required`. Use `--replace` to delete and recreate the resource in one run.

## What does --stop do?

Some configuration updates can only be applied while an instance is stopped.

When you run `incus-apply` with `--stop`, a running instance is stopped before the update, updated, and then started again afterwards.

If that restart path will be used, the preview shows a `restart` note in the diff output.

## How do variables work?

Declare variables in a `type: vars` document and reference them in resource documents with `$VAR` or `${VAR}`. See [configuration-reference.md](./configuration-reference.md) for syntax and scoping rules.

## Why are some preview values shown as [redacted]?

Instance `config.environment.*` values are hidden in preview output by default so secrets do not leak in diffs. This only affects preview rendering. Use `--show-env` to reveal them.

## How are resources named in preview output?

Preview output uses the resource's effective scope in the identifier.

- Project-scoped resources use `project:type/name`.
- Pool-scoped storage resources use `project:type/pool/name`.
- Global resources use `type/name`.

Examples: `default:instance/web`, `default:storage-volume/pool1/data`, and `storage-pool/fast`.

## Can I define multiple resources in one file?

Yes. Use multi-document YAML with `---` separators.

## Can I load configs from a directory, stdin, or a URL?

Yes. `incus-apply` supports local files, recursive directory discovery, `-` for stdin, and remote URLs.

## Where can I find example configs?

See [../examples/](../examples/) for sample configurations.

## Is there editor schema support?

Yes. A generated schema file is available for editor validation and autocomplete. See [editor-schema.md](./editor-schema.md).
